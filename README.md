#üßì SilverTouch

>‚ÄúAn app for the elderly, touched by the elderly.‚Äù
>A mobile service designed to support independent seniors by confirming their safety and alleviating social isolation.


## üß≠ Overview

SilverTouch is a mobile health and community app for elderly individuals living alone.
As the population ages rapidly, the number of seniors living alone continues to increase.
However, many still suffer from physical inactivity, lack of information access, and social isolation.
To address these issues through technology, SilverTouch was designed with four key pillars: Walking, Gathering, Notification, and Information Access.

## üéØ Background and Direction

Survival Check: Detect abnormal behavior using step count and location data, and send alerts to guardians.
Social Connection: Encourage local interaction and participation through walking meetups.
Information Accessibility: Provide easy access to government welfare and health policies within the app.
User-Friendly UI/UX: Simple navigation structure and visually emphasized design tailored to senior users.
This app goes beyond simple feature implementation ‚Äî it is designed to genuinely support seniors in their daily lives.
